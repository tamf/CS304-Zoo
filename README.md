## Description

Relational database application of a zoo visitation and management simulation using *JDBC* and *Oracle SQL*. The app itself could be used in zoo management as a piece of management software (though this is probably unlikely) to keep track of the various stockkeeping, animal life and employees of a zoo. It also has a clean, fairly simple and easily understandable UI and quick querying with responsive feedback and error messaging.
