Our project was a fun way for us to learn SQL and querying remotely in the format of a zoo visitation and management simulation. The app itself could be used in zoo management as a piece of management software (though this is probably unlikely) to keep track of the various stockkeeping, animal life and employees of a zoo. It also has a clean, fairly simple and easily understandable UI and quick querying with responsive feedback and error messaging. Overall, it is a simple, neat piece of software and was an excellent learning tool for our group.
